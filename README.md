## Intro

For over 4 years, I’ve been working with data – reporting, validating its accuracy, and do various types of analysis. Over time, my work started to focus more and more on verifying data consistency and identifying differances between reports and databases. This naturally led me to think, “What if I took this a step further and started testing entire applications, not just data?” That thought sparked my journey into software testing, where I’ve been combining my analytical skills with a passion for quality. You can find the results of this journey in my portfolio.
